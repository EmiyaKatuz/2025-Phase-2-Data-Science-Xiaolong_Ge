In the data set of W store, there are 3 major parts, including features, stores, and sales data. They have 17 features and 423325 instances in total after I merged them.

It's very hard to merge because there are duplicate columns like IsHoliday_x and IsHoliday appears in both features and sales data sets to deal with. After merging, it will have a lot of features ranging from temperature, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment rates, store type, store size, to promotional activities in markdown columns. So the dataset is rich in features.

I plot the data in histograms, count plots, time series analysis, and scatter matrix plots. I found that the temperature data has seasonal variations over time, and store types have a pretty balanced distribution in the data set. In the scatter matrix, there are no obvious relationships between features. What we can know is that
1. Fuel prices have multiple peaks, which may mean that they have high volatility.
2. Unemployment distribution is right-skewed, which means few people are unemployed.
Holiday distribution showed the data set has data for both holiday and non-holiday, and non-holiday time is almost 10 times of the holiday data.

In the data cleaning part, most of the issues are because of the NA values. And they almost cover all 5 markdown columns. Only a few NA rows (compared to markdown columns) appear in CPI, Unemployment, Dept, Weekly_Sales. Since promotional markdowns mean there are no promotional activities, I just fill in 0 to replace NA values. By using the box plot, we can find there are some extreme values in the Markdown5, so I deployed a standardization on the numeric features to make them have the same scale.

In the correlation matrix, we can find that there are high relationships between (markdown1, markdown4) and (size, type), moderate relationships between economic indicators, while the correlations between other features are weak, so we can conclude that there are no severe multicollinearity issues in the data set.

Moreover, I created a new MarkDownTotal feature by summing all the individual markdown columns, because I think it can provide a strong power of prediction in the intensity of promotion. And we can find that the new feature is highly correlated with markdown1, markdown4, and markdown5. But it only has moderate correlations with markdown2 and markdown3. For other features, it only has weak relationships.

In short, this is a very meaningful exploration of the data set. We find many interesting findings, and I also learned some useful skills like converting categorical variables to numeric ones, mapping store types to numeric codes, and converting boolean holiday indicators to binary values.
